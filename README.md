## HTMLumia830
My Lumia 830 Smartphone recreated with HTML, Javascript and CSS

# Demo
- [HTML Lumia 830](https://dev.bogdanbucur.eu/awesomest-projects/lumia-830/)

#Why?
Because I like my phone

# Features
On top of the whole "it looks like Lumia 830" part, this project contains some other features that try to recreate some Windows Phone 8.1 functionalities:

- the date and time on the screensaver are accurate and they change the position on screen each minute
- you can swipe up the screensaver to reveal the start screen image
